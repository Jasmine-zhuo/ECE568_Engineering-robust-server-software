1.We should do error-checking on getaddrinfo(), and walk through the "host_info_list" linked list,looking for
valid entries instead of just assuming the first one is good!

2.We should check for any error after the call to "setsockopt"!!

3.We didn't manage request methods other than GET/POST/CONNECT

4.The failures we could handle were mainly errors in socket programming. We wraped the entire "handler" function with try<-->catch block that we learned in ECE551. On failure, the thrown exception will be catched and thus no futher stacks needs to be desctructed.

5.The exception guarantee was STRONG. The reason is that, on failure, our cache might have been modified but no dangling pointers will be left.

6.We didn't test very-large inputs and very-long time to figure out if our cache still behaves as expected.

7.In connect method, we didn't use while loops to do the receiving. This seems fine in the tests, but could lead do disaster if a really huge input shows up.
